/* uring_reader — a thin, single-owner io_uring wrapper for the RDMA server's
 * async GET (kRange) disk-read path. ADDITIVE + env-gated: only used when the
 * server is built with -DDFKV_WITH_URING and started with DFKV_SERVER_URING=1.
 *
 * Design = Mooncake's batch_read pattern (uring_file.cpp) adapted to dfkv's
 * per-WaitComp completion batch:
 *  - One ring per connection serve loop (single owner => no locking).
 *  - BatchRead() submits up to QUEUE_DEPTH independent O_DIRECT preads at once
 *    (each its own fd/buffer/offset), then waits for the WHOLE batch to complete
 *    before returning. Concurrency comes from QD>1 reads in flight; ordering is
 *    irrelevant inside the ring because every read lands in its own buffer.
 *  - The serve loop only PostSendScatters AFTER BatchRead() returns (all reads
 *    done), iterating the descriptors in arrival order — so replies are strictly
 *    in request order with no reorder buffer.
 *
 * Header-only and #ifdef'd on DFKV_WITH_URING so the rest of the server compiles
 * unchanged when liburing is absent. */
